# passportJsAuth_Assignment

### This repository contains code for using PassportJs for authentication in your react application. You can login using Google and Github authentication methods.
For running the facebook authentication method you will need a secure domain as it will not work on apps running on localhost or unsecure domains.
This also uses cookie session in conjunction with PassportJs. You can set the time limit for a particula cookie as per your liking.
